    "# Q1. What is the main difference between the Euclidean distance metric and the Manhattan distance\n",
    "# metric in KNN? How might this difference affect the performance of a KNN classifier or regressor?\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "Euclidean distance is like the straight-line distance between two points, similar to how a bird might fly \n",
    "between two locations. It calculates the square root of the sum of squared differences between corresponding \n",
    "coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Manhattan distance, on the other hand, is like the distance a taxi would travel on a grid-like street layout\n",
    "to reach a destination. It measures the sum of absolute differences between corresponding coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The impact on KNN performance depends on the nature of our data. If our features are measured in a way where \n",
    "straight-line distance is more meaningful, then Euclidean distance might be appropriate. However, if our \n",
    "features represent categories or factors, and the relationships are more grid-like or step-wise, Manhattan \n",
    "distance could be more suitable."

    "2. Grid search or randomized search: Try out a range of k values and evaluate their performance. Grid search\n",
    "checks every value in the chosen range, while randomized search samples values more efficiently.\n",
